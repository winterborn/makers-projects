# Intermezzo: Instantiating Objects from Classes


## Introduction

We have had a look at Classes, how to define them, what they're used for and how we can put them to use. 

In this intermezzo section, we are going to look a little deeper at classes, objects, and how to use them all with a bit more confidence. 

## Repeatable Execution

Why do we use classes in Software Development? Why do we use methods? Functions? If you've got to this stage in Ruby Foundtions, you've undoubtably had a go at making your own in the drills - but what is the point?

The entire idea of learning increasingly complex object creation, from variables to functions, to hashes, to classes; is to make our lives easier. 

And storing executable code, or information, or instructions, in these code blocks, does make our lives a lot easier becuase it allows us to write something once, and then repeat it as many times s we wish.

For the variable, we need only invoke it's name:

``` ruby
variable_one = 10

variable_one += 15

variable_one *= 4
variable_one /= 50

p variable_one
```
For the function we need only make the function call:

``` ruby
def greeting(name)
    p "Hello there, #{name}!"
end

greeting("Will")

greeting("Arthur")

greeting("Maggie")
```

For the class, we should instantiate it:

``` ruby
class Cake
    def initialize
        @flavour = ""
        @size = 100
    end
    def set_flavour(flavour)
        @flavour = flavour
    end
    def take_slice(slice)
        @size -= slice
        p "You have taken a #{slice} sized slice. There is #{size} percent cake remaining."
    end
end

gateau = Cake.new
gateau.set_flavour = "Double Chocolate"
gateau.take_slice(40)

```

Notice the difference between regular function calls `some_function(argument)` and instance method calls `new_obj.method_name(argument)`?

## Exercise 1

Set a timer for 10 minutes.

Your challenge is to copy the following code out into a new Ruby file, load the file in `IRB` with `> load 'bakery.rb'` and build out your bakery, and taste as many cakes as you can!

Don't fill up on too much of one cake, or your bakery isn't going to make it!

```ruby
class Cake
    def initialize
        @flavour = ""
        @size = 100
    end
    def set_flavour(flavour)
        @flavour = flavour
    end
    def take_slice(slice)
        @size -= slice
        p "You have taken a #{slice} percent sized slice. There is #{@size} percent cake remaining."
    end
    attr_reader :flavour, :size
end

class Baker 
    def initialize
    @stomach_space_remaining = 100
    # You can only eat up to 100 sections of cake in one sitting.
    @cakes_sampled = []
    # You must sample at least 5 cakes in order to ensure quality!
    
    end
    
    def eat_cake(cake, slice)
        cake.take_slice(slice)
        if @cakes_sampled.include? cake
            "You've tried this one already!"
        else
            @cakes_sampled << cake
            @stomach_space_remaining -= slice
        end
    end

    def check_space
        p "You have eaten #{@cakes_sampled.length} cakes. You have #{@stomach_space_remaining} percent space remaining in your belly!"
        if @cakes_sampled.length > 4
            p "You have sampled more than enough cake. Time to open the shop!"       
            exit()
        elsif @stomach_space_remaining < 0
            p "You have filled up on too much cake. You pass out. The shop makes no business this day."
            exit()
        end
        @stomach_space_remaining
    end

    def cakes?
        @cakes_sampled.each {|cake| puts cake.flavour}
    end

    def choose_favourite
        puts "Which was your favourite cake?"
        cakes?()
        puts "Pick the number as it appears in the list."
        choice = gets
        choice = choice.to_i - 1
        return "#{@cakes_sampled[choice].flavour} was your favourite!"
    end
end


# Intended input/output in IRB:
#
# > cake = Cake.new
# => #<Cake:0x00000001359f5610 @flavour="", @size=100>
# > cake.set_flavour("Vanilla")
# => "Vanilla"
# > will = Baker.new
# => #<Baker:0x0000000127854c60 @stomach_space_remaining=100, @cakes_sampled=[]>
# > will.eat_cake(cake, 20)
# => "You have taken a 20 percent sized slice. There is 80 percent cake remaining."
# > will.check_space
# "You have eaten 0 cakes. You have 100 percent space remaining in your belly!"
# => 100

```

## Exercise 2

The next exercise requires you to either copy, or clone the Bakery 2.0.rb file.

You must load the 'bakery_2.0.rb' file into irb, and do your best to satisfy the orders being placed at your Cakery!

You can find a link to it [here](slug/materials/universe/foundations/ruby/chapter2/bakery_2.0.rb).
